# Functions

The inuitcss `functions` module—like `mixins`—contains a few framework functions
that are **required** for using any of the rest of inuitcss.

Install using Bower:

    $ bower install --save inuitless-functions

# LESS, SASS and functions

Unfortunately, LESS 1.7 is not handling functions as SASS does. Thus, this
module is still empty for now and won't be included as a dependency in others.

# Note

This is the LESS port of [the inuit.css project](http://inuitcss.com), from [@csswizardry](https://twitter.com/csswizardry).

The original SASS repo could be find here: <https://github.com/inuitcss/tools.functions>
